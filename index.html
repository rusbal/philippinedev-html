Give me ssh access to a bare VPS and I'll give you a working web application server. Through the years of experience, I gained technical skills and intuitive understanding of systems to address my client business requirements. I take pride of my work, I write beautiful code, I employ best practice.</p><h2>Ruby on Rails, PHP Laravel, Vue JS, Javascript, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Linux, Nginx, Ansible</h2><p>Please see my <a href="/assets/pdfs/raymond.usbal.resume.aug.2020.pdf" target="_blank"> résumé</a> for more information. </p><h2>Reviews</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Michel G. Thouati, Ph.D. (France)</strong><div class="review">"Raymond is a strong and experienced developer, with excellent analytical skills and good OO design patterns. He can build well-architected systems from the ground up. He can be trusted to produce high-quality OO PHP5 code. His SQL queries are solid. His code is readable and maintainable. His UI sense is top notch, a rare quality for the strong backend coder he is. He is honest and trustworthy. I wholeheartedly endorse his output."</div></p></li><li><p><strong>Ivan Mantelli (Australia)</strong><div class="review">"Raymond is a unique programmer who combines project management skills, in depth coding knowledge, clear communication and above all a great work ethic and honesty which is critical when working across different continents and timezones. We have used Raymond extensively to help build the lending and borrowing applications and systems that drive the Lending Hub peer to peer loans website. We recommend Raymond and his team to business owners and webmasters who are looking for someone who can code the fine detail but also help you manage your project."</div></p></li><li><p><strong>Sebastian Shen (Haulio Pte Ltd, Singapore)</strong><div class="review">"Working with Raymond has been a real pleasure. There are 2 strengths of his that I want to highlight here.  Firstly, he's a full-stack developer. As the saying goes - If you want to move fast, move alone. It's very true for Raymond. He is able to build out both the backend business logic with the front end user interface within a very short time. Great for new project implementations.  Secondly, he's a very experienced engineer who is experienced in the basic requirements of UIUX. In my work with him, he has pleasantly surprised me several times with self-initiated implementations of email notifications and confirmation buttons. I don't have to tell him everything, don’t have to explain every single step -- he understands the business purpose and implements really.  I'm confident he will really be a great help to any project/organization."</div></p></li><li><p><strong>Michael Zhou (Culturally.co, Singapore)</strong><div class="review">"Overall, Raymond has been a fantastic developer to work with. He is a fast learner: he was able to become proficient in a new language extremely fast and the existing codebase I wrote very fast. Raymond sets up the codebase in a way that the codebase is welcoming of future enhancements - he does not take shortcuts to get the job done hastily; he thinks through the structure and embeds robustness into every decision he makes with the code. This is very important, it could mean huge savings in future technical debt that one may not even realise one is incurring. Raymond is also responsive and punctual for a remote worker. He reports to work on time and can be trusted to work through the tasks remotely. At times, I do advise Raymond to be meticulous and careful in testing all the possible scenarios before finalising his work."</div></p></li></ul><p>Please see my <a href="/assets/pdfs/raymond.usbal.resume.aug.2020.pdf" target="_blank"> résumé</a> for more information. </p><small>Updated on 21 aug.2020.</small><p></p></div><div id="sidebar"><h2>Raymond Usbal</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymond-usbal-816318b1/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li></ul><h2>Download</h2><ul><li><a download="raymond.usbal.resume.apr.2020.pdf" href="/assets/pdfs/raymond.usbal.resume.apr.2020.pdf"> Résumé</a></li></ul><h2>Contact</h2><ul><li><a href="mailto: raymond@philippinedev.com?subject=Inquiry from website" target="_blank">Email</a></li></ul></div></body></html>
